Developed Software
=====================

* `The Ensemblator <http://www.github.com/atomoton/ensemblator>`_ 
    Python program to generate and analyze ensembles of protein structures. Uses a novel "core" based method for determining optimal structural overlays. Groups for comparison can be manually defined, or automatically detected using clustering. Capable of comparing ensembles of non-identical proteins, using sequence alignment before structural overlay.

* `The Reassigner <http://www.github.com/atomoton/reassigner>`_
    Python program capable of assigning secondary structure to a pdb formatted protein structure. Assigns by using a combination of results from machine learning assignments of secondary structure based on local conformation, and a calculation of a virtual geometry. Capable of a very large range of intelligent secondary structure assignments.
