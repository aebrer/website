Andrew E. Brereton
=====================

*A formally trained structural biologist with an emphasis in data science and visualization, machine learning, and software development. Research interests are varied but include neurobiology, human/animal intelligence, sleep biology, aging, perception, and protein structure/design problems.*

Software Development Projects
=================================

* `The Ensemblator <http://www.github.com/atomoton/ensemblator>`_ 
    Python program to generate and analyze ensembles of protein structures. Uses a novel "core" based method for determining optimal structural overlays. Groups for comparison can be manually defined, or automatically detected using clustering. Capable of comparing ensembles of non-identical proteins, using sequence alignment before structural overlay.

* `The Reassigner <http://www.github.com/atomoton/reassigner>`_
    Python program capable of assigning secondary structure to a pdb formatted protein structure. Assigns by using a combination of results from machine learning assignments of secondary structure based on local conformation, and a calculation of a virtual geometry. Capable of a very large range of intelligent secondary structure assignments.

* `Uncomplicated I Ching <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.brereton.iching2>`_
    A minimal android app to enable consulting the I Ching Oracle.
