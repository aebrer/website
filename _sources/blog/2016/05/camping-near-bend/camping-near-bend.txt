Over the Memorial Day weekend, I went camping and hiking with some friends. We headed into the Willamette National Forest for some camping, and also hiked up Black Butte Mountain. Here are some photos from the trip!


The first night we camped in the Willamette National Forest off Kohfield Rd. It was dark, so we didn't spend very long looking for a campsite. We ended up in this kind of desert-ish site, which was actually a pretty cool place to camp. Here is what we saw the next morning (click load panorama and scroll to the bottom of the page):

The next day, we headed to the Black Butte trail-head, for some hiking. We were planning to meet our non-camping friends at the peak.

We begin the hike pretty fresh.

The views as we got higher got more and more incredible.

Eventually though the steep incline began to wear us down. I tired much more quickly than Austin, who seem like she could go on climbing forever...

Near the peak, there was evidence of recent forest fires.

Finally, at the top, we stopped to enjoy a Black Butte Porter.

We met up with the others, took a few quick photos, then left for the next campsite.

That evening we made it to our second campsite, in the Willamette National Forest off NF-525. This site had a lot more bugs, but was a lot more interesting to camp at. When we got there, there was already a firepit. Someone forgot about "leave no trace"...

That turquoise thing is an inflatable couch.



    
We also managed to get enough wood to have a decent fire for cooking.

Overall it was a great trip, and I can't wait for more camping and climbing!
