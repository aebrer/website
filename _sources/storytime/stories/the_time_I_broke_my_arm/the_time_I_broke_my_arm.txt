The Story
*********

I used to live in Canada, until recently. I lived near a small town called **Parry Sound**; it was an eleven-minute drive into town from my house, and I lived at the top of a small hill overlooking a lake. In the summer it was warm and nice, and in the winter it was cold and entirely covered in snow. This particular winter had been a good one for snow, so there must have been maybe four feet on the ground that day, fresh. I feel like all of this must have been happening when I was in Grade 9, and the lake was totally frozen, so my guess would be that this took place sometime around **February 2010**.

The special thing about the two-week period this story took place in is that my Mom was gone [:cbgreen:`to a conference I think`] [:cbblue:`For the record I had gone to the Shoppers [Drug Mart] Conference in San Francisco.  It was 2008 I believe.`], and my best friend Zach’s family came to stay in our house and take care of us (me, my brother, and my infant sister) in the meantime. For me, this was the best possible situation: it meant I would spend all my free time hanging out with Zach and doing fun stuff. Very soon into this two week babysitting period, there was a big snowfall. Naturally, Zach and I decided to go tobogganing. There are a lot of places in town for this [:cbgreen:`I can’t remember the name of the hill they later paved over for some reason, I think it started with a “K”`] [:cbred:`Kinsmen`], and normally we would go there (and then nothing bad would have happened). This time however, the sheer volume of fresh snow allowed us to do something different. The hill in my backyard that led down to the lake was usually a strict no-tobogganing location, because the hill was densely populated by evergreen trees of varying sizes. Since the hill is also very steep, steering to avoid these tree trunks wasn’t usually possible, and so we just avoided the whole situation. This time, we could take our flying saucers [:cbgreen:`those dangerous disk things`], flatten out a sort of luge track between the trees, all the way down to the ledge over the frozen lake. All in all we would very quickly shoot down the hill, between the trees, hit the ledge and soar about five feet into the air, landing hard onto the frozen lake and sliding out 40-50 feet until we came to a stop. It might seem like this is the point where I would break my arm, but it’s not. It worked perfectly. I still remember this as one of the most fun times I’ve ever spent tobogganing, and overall I think it was worth what came later.

So Zach and I did this over and over. We must have been outside, doing this same sledding route, again and again, for four or five hours. Eventually we heard a voice calling to us. One of Zach’s parents yelling that dinner was ready, and that we had to come in and eat. I don’t think we were too upset about this, and we ran in and ate dinner. After dinner however, it only seemed natural that we continue to enjoy the rare tobogganing route we had created. We grabbed our winter gear and our sleds, and we headed out into the night. The key difference about now vs earlier, is that it had become pitch black. There were no lights outside, so we took small pen flashlights and stuck them behind our ears, under our toques [:cbgreen:`that's beanies for my American friends`]. This gave us a small spot of light, about three or four feet in diameter, and a few feet in front of us. Armed against the night, we trudged back to the top of the hill, and stood with anticipation at the precipice. [:cbred:`I think it was snowing too, was it not?`] [:cbgreen:`Ah yes, it wasn't earlier, or not much, but then when we got back outside it was really coming down and limiting visibility.`]

To understand how exciting this hill was at the time, you need to understand something about me. I am in no way an adrenaline junkie, or a risk taker, and I was even more of a scared baby when I was a teenager/pre-teen. It was unheard of for me to offer to be the first one to try something risky, or jump off the cliff into the lake, or anything really. So, it really shows how excited I was, and how safe I felt it was, that when Zach hesitated before going down, I loudly exclaimed that I would go first. I distinctly remember thinking to myself, *“If we’ve been doing it all day with no problems, how dangerous can it be?”* I got onto my saucer, made sure my flashlight was working, and asked Zach for a little push. I immediately took off down the hill, and was absolutely surprised.

It was **beautiful**.

The small circle of light in front of me showed only the ground racing by. I could hear the wind whipping past and the acoustics changing as I passed the trees with only a hair of extra room between me and certain death. The thrill, the sense of speed, the novelty were all magnified a thousand fold by doing it at night, in the dark, and I let out a loud yell of excitement as I flew down the hill. Then I hit the ledge at the bottom, took off, and learned something new about the behavior of light. It came to me then, as I felt my saucer fall out from under me, that when the light wasn’t pointed on the ground exactly in front of me, the beam would just aim off into the distant night, and leave me unable to see anything. As I flew through the dark, I had just enough time to realize that I had made a mistake.

I’d like to say that I tried to get my arms in front of me to break my fall, or that I really had tried anything at all to save myself, but I didn’t. I couldn’t see the ground, at all. I only knew I was in the air, and that I had two seconds at most before I hit. Then I hit the ground. I landed entirely on my left arm, with it being braced between my body and the ice. I heard a loud snap, in my brain seemingly, and didn’t actually feel all that much pain. I looked around, stunned, rolled onto my back, and looked at my arm in the flashlight. It was very very broken. One thing that I gained from this experience is that aside from just looking and seeing the wrong angle where your limbs are, you can also just tell when you broke something. There is a sort of sense to it, an intimate knowledge that something in your arm is now deeply wrong. While I thought about these details, I let out a sort of excited, pained yell. 

Zach yelled at me from above, “Was it awesome?!”

I replied, “Don’t come down!” He misheard me and asked, 

“What?!”

“Don’t come down!”

“Come down?!”

“No!”

“Okay I’m coming down!”

With that Zach courageously jumped onto his saucer and began his descent. My life was flashing before my eyes, but at the last second he saw my light at the bottom of the hill, unmoved, and he managed to bail from his saucer and roll himself to a stop, just before hitting the ledge. He stood up and asked me what was wrong. I told him I had broken my arm. There was a few seconds of silence while he processed this, then he asked, 

“Are you sure?”

**…**

I screamed, “Yes I’m fucking sure! It’s broken! Get your dad!”

To his credit he believed me, didn’t ask to look, and instead just took off running toward the house. After about five minutes or so, Zach and his dad returned, and some of the shock had begun to wear off (or get worse, depending on how you look at it). Mark [:cbgreen:`Zach’s father`] asked me the same questions as Zach, including the now classic “Are you sure?” In answer I just held up my arm, so that the angle was visible, and that laid any doubts to rest. Like father like son I suppose. Mark came over and helped me up, and carried me up the hill and into the house. From there we got into the car, and drove to the Emergency room at the hospital in town.

I mentioned before that I live in a small town. The population was 6500, so this wasn’t a particularly bustling hospital. It was off-season, and late at night, and a Saturday [:cbgreen:`maybe Friday?`], so for whatever reason they couldn’t take any X-rays. Since they knew my arm was very messed up, they didn’t want to put a cast on until they knew if they had to set it or not. What they did instead was give me some Tylenol, put my arm in a sling, and tell me to keep it elevated and come back Monday. Even today that seems a little strange to me.

So Zach’s parents took me home, and I spent the weekend in bed, reading and watching TV, and then on Monday they took me back and I was knocked out, my arm was rebroken and set, and they put a nice big cast on it. To date, my left wrist still clicks and grinds when I rotate it. I sprained it recently, had it X-rayed, and the doctor remarked that there is some sort of bone spur there now. Zach’s parents called my Mom, and told her that I was in the hospital, etc, and later we all laughed about it. [:cbblue:`When Sandra called I was in a meeting.  She started the conversation 'for the record - no one is dead, there was blood, but no one is dead!'.`] That was the last time Zach’s family came over to babysit us (but in reality none of it was their fault, and I don’t think anyone blamed them).

That’s the story of the time I broke my arm.

    Yes, I really looked like that.



*PS. That was the second bad thing to happen while they babysat us. The first was that I almost killed my brother, so maybe this was some sort of karma.*

[:cbred:`This actually made me giggle like an idiot in front of people…`]
