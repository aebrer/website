Hello and welcome to Storytime! Here, I intend to post stories about things that happened to me in my past, as I actually remember them. Some of these stories have been told and retold so often that I doubt I am even anywhere close to remembering the truth, and I also have a pretty non-functional episodic memory anyway, so this should be an interesting experiment.

To keep me honest, I intend to enlist the help of my family, friends, and enemies. I hope to reach out and receive comments for each of the stories I post, from most of the people involved.

If you see a title you like, give it a read, and please enjoy!
