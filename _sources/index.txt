About Me
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hello! I am a PhD student at Oregon State University, studying biophysics. My research currently involves a lot of programming and data analysis, and I also like to do data analysis for other (non-protein) topics. On this website you'll find links to my `Cirriculum Vitae <brereton-cv.html>`_, my various projects (like `The Ensemblator <http://github.com/atomoton/ensemblator>`_), and my `blog <blog/blog.html>`_.

Recent Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
