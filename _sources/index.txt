About Me
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hello! I am a PhD student at Oregon State University, studying biophysics. My research currently involves a lot of programming and data analysis, and I also like to do data analysis for other (non-protein) topics. On this website you'll find links to my `Cirriculum Vitae <brereton-cv.html>`_, my various projects (like `The Ensemblator <http://github.com/atomoton/ensemblator>`_), and my `blog <blog/blog.html>`_.

Recent Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`I finally updated my I Ching app for Android. It doesn't suck now! <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.brereton.iching2>`_


`A new section of the website, Storytime, where I write collaborative stories from my past. The first one is about the time that I broke my arm. <https://brereton.me/storytime/stories/the_time_I_broke_my_arm/the_time_I_broke_my_arm.html>`_
