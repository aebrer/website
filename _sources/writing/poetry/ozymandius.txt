I wrote this haiku in an attempt to recreate the feeling of the original.

Ozymandius
#################


|    Shifting drifts of sand 
|    Lazily etch their message
|    In the old king's plaque. 
|
|    Words that used to read
|    "Upon my works, ye mighty
|    Gaze and feel despair!"
|
|    Despite my straining, 
|    All I sense is the endless
|    Whisper of the sands.
|
