Peer-reviewed Publications
===========================

1. \A. \E. Brereton, P. A. Karplus, **"On the reliability of peptide non-planarity seen in ultra-high resolution crystal structures."** *Protein Science*. (2016). DOI: `10.1002/pro.2883 <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pro.2883/full>`_
2. \A. \E. Brereton, P. A. Karplus, **"Native proteins trap high-energy transit conformations."** *Science Advances.* 1, e1501188 (2015). DOI: `10.1126/sciadv.1501188 <http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/9/e1501188>`_

Developed Software
=====================

* `The Ensemblator <http://www.github.com/atomoton/ensemblator>`_ 
    Python program to generate and analyze ensembles of protein structures. Uses a novel "core" based method for determining optimal structural overlays. Groups for comparison can be manually defined, or automatically detected using clustering. Capable of comparing ensembles of non-identical proteins, using sequence alignment before structural overlay.

* `The Reassigner <http://www.github.com/atomoton/reassigner>`_
    Python program capable of assigning secondary structure to a pdb formatted protein structure. Assigns by using a combination of results from machine learning assignments of secondary structure based on local conformation, and a calculation of a virtual geometry. Capable of a very large range of intelligent secondary structure assignments.

* `Uncomplicated I Ching <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.brereton.iching2&hl=en>`_
    A simple Android app to use the I Ching.
