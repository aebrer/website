<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve become interested in the effects of a particular mutation.
The mutation is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a protein
called Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase 1 (AMPD1). In this case, the
nucleotide base at this position was <em>supposed</em> to be a &ldquo;C&rdquo; (cytosine),
but it&rsquo;s been changed to a &ldquo;T&rdquo; (thymine). This single letter mutation
has been called &ldquo;the most prevalent genetic disease mutation&rdquo;, at least
in Caucasians<a href="#references"><sup>1</sup></a>. In fact, another study found the mutant allele
(meaning just having one copy of the mutation, instead of two) in 12% of
Caucasians and 19% of African-Americans<a href="#references"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs17602729">The SNPedia entry for the SNP can be seen
here</a></p>

<p>The effect of this SNP is to change a codon (an instruction for a
particular amino acid) into a stop signal for constructing the AMPD1
protein. So for people who inherited this mutation from both parents,
there will be no AMPD1 protein in their body&hellip; almost. In actuality,
there is a &ldquo;mini-exon&rdquo; which actually contains the mutation, and in most
organs and tissues, this exon is excluded from the protein.</p>

<p>This means that in most organs and tissues the protein still exists. The
version of the AMPD instructions (the mRNA) that contain the newly made
stop signal is mostly expressed in skeletal muscle, and in fact, even
0.6-2% of the protein in muscle skips the exon, so there will be a tiny
amount of this protein present in some people with this mutation<a href="#references"><sup>3</sup></a>.
This is hypothesized to be why many people with this mutation never
notice any symptoms of muscle soreness.</p>

<p>So, this mutation primarily manifests as a missing enzyme in muscle
cells. Perhaps for this reason, most of the research on this mutation
has been in exercise science. The symptoms are typically listed as
muscle pain or cramps after exercise, and people are considered
asymptomatic if they don&rsquo;t present these symptoms<a href="#references"><sup>4</sup></a>. Part of the
purpose of this post is to demonstrate why I think the symptoms of this
mutation could be more broad than expected, and that many people don&rsquo;t
notice or suspect the symptoms because the effects can be more subtle
than muscle soreness.</p>

<h2 id="getting-into-the-details">Getting Into the Details</h2>

<h3 id="pathway-problems">Pathway Problems</h3>

<p>To get a better handle on the potential effects of this mutation, let&rsquo;s
take a look at the pathway involved (taken from the KEGG database):</p>

<p><img src="/blog/resources/entire_pathway.png" alt="Oh no. This is too much." /></p>

<p>At first glace, it&rsquo;s pretty overwhelming. This is how I felt throughout
the entirety of my biochemistry classes. Eventually I did learn that
these pathways become much more manageable once you &ldquo;zoom in&rdquo; and focus
on one region at a time. So let&rsquo;s take a closer look:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/resources/pathway.png" alt="Much more manageable. Our little slice of Purine Nucleotide
Metabolism." /></p>

<p>This part of the pathway highlights the metabolites and enzymes we&rsquo;re
interested in. Essentially, once AMP is generated (by exercise,
thinking, living, etc.) it&rsquo;s converted into IMP by our belle of the ball
(I&rsquo;m sorry), AMPD, and then IMP is converted into Inosine, to
Hypoxanthine, and then eventually all the way back to the other
nucleosides or ATP. As well as conversion from AMP to IMP, AMP can be
dephosphorylated into Adenosine directly, and then Adenosine can be
converted to Inosine, etc, etc. A simplified version of this might look
like this:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/resources/simple_path.png" alt="The *even nicer* version of the
pathway." /></p>

<p>So with AMPD missing in some cells (mostly skeletal muscle), AMP can&rsquo;t
be converted to IMP, and is instead converted to Adenosine (meaning more
Adenosine than usual). The AMPD1 isoform of the protein being absent in
muscle cells is significant, as much more AMPD is normally present in
skeletal muscle. In cardiac or smooth muscle, brain, liver, and the
kidneys the AMPD activity is only a few percent of that seen in skeletal
muscles<a href="#references"><sup>5</sup></a>. Consistent with this, it <strong>has</strong> been experimentally
observed that homozygotes for the C34T mutation have significantly
higher levels of Adenosine in their blood following exercise<a href="#references"><sup>6</sup></a>, and
16-fold higher levels of Adenosine in muscle<a href="#references"><sup>7</sup></a>. The problems with this
are threefold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Adenosine readily crosses the blood brain barrier</li>
<li>Adenosine is a tightly regulated hormone for regulating sleep (and other things)</li>
<li>Adenosine has effects throughout the body</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;ll go into some details on how Adenosine functions in the body, but to
some degree it can be intuitively understood by anyone who has some
familiarity with Caffeine. If you drink coffee regularly, and you go
without, you feel the effects of too much Adenosine pretty quickly. Over
time, Caffeine consumption causes: a 20-30% increase in the number of
receptors (sensors in the body) for Adenosine<a href="#references"><sup>8</sup></a>; increased sensitivity
of Adenosine receptors<a href="#references"><sup>9</sup></a>; and increased concentration of Adenosine in
the blood<a href="#references"><sup>10</sup></a>. These are all thought to arise as the body&rsquo;s mechanism
for responding to blocked signals to Adenosine receptors, which is the
mechanism by which Caffeine works (and makes you feel stimulated). So if
you&rsquo;ve ever felt that <em>&ldquo;need a cup of coffee so so bad&rdquo;</em> feeling, you&rsquo;ve
felt something akin to the acute effects of too much Adenosine.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the point of Adenosine anyway?</p>

<h3 id="actions-of-adenosine">Actions of Adenosine</h3>

<p>Adenosine does many important things in the body, primarily through the
activation of four receptors, called A1, A2a, A2b, and A3. Most
importantly (in my subjective opinion), Adenosine levels regulate sleep
and perceived levels of sleepiness, through A1 and A2a activity<a href="#references"><sup>11</sup></a>, and
increased Adenosine decreases neuronal activity<a href="#references"><sup>12</sup></a>. The role of sleep
regulation performed by Adenosine is typically reffered to as Sleep
Homeostasis:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/resources/homeostasis.jpg" alt="Figure from
&lt;http://www.howsleepworks.com/&gt;" /></p>

<p>In this figure, the blue line represents the amount of Adenosine in the
blood (or more importantly, available to the brain). As time passes in a
wakeful state, &ldquo;sleep pressure&rdquo; or sleep load builds up, and is relieved
by sleeping. The sensations of sleepiness, and the other effects of
sleep deprivation, are partly due to the effects of Adenosine on its
receptors.</p>

<p>Some (but not all) of the other effects of Adenosine include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Decreased heart rate and antiarrhythmic effect (It&rsquo;s prescribed as a
drug for this effect)</li>
<li>Cardiac muscle relaxation</li>
<li>Smooth muscle Contraction</li>
<li>Coronary artery vasodilation</li>
<li>Cardioprotective in cardiac ischemia<a href="#references"><sup>14</sup></a></li>
<li>Bone homeostasis<a href="#references"><sup>15</sup></a></li>
<li>Downregulation of inflammation and protection from tissue damage<a href="#references"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
<li>Increases insulin sensitivity<a href="#references"><sup>17</sup></a></li>
</ol>

<p>There are many other effects of Adenosine on the body, but it&rsquo;s beyond
the scope of this simple blog post to discuss them all. A good place to
start if you&rsquo;re interested in finding out more is a review, and the
bibliography of that review. This seems like a decent one<a href="#references"><sup>18</sup></a>:</p>

receptors and their genes.&rdquo; Naunyn-Schmiedeberg&rsquo;s archives of
pharmacology 362.4-5 (2000): 364-374.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="effects-of-ampd1-deficiency">Effects of AMPD1 Deficiency</h3>

<p>This is where it gets interesting. As I mentioned before, much of the
literature published about AMPD1 deficiency only discuss muscle soreness
and damage as the effect of this mutation. However, there are some other
studies out there that have observed other interesting effects.</p>

<h4 id="cardioprotective-effects">Cardioprotective Effects</h4>

<p>Many studies have found a cardioprotective effect in possessing the
AMPD1 mutation, and some have even found better recovery after heart
surgery<a href="#references"><sup>6,19-20</sup></a>. This is consistent with elevated levels of Adenosine
in cardiac tissue, which itself is consistent with the observed levels
of AMPD1 in tissue: high AMPD1 in skeletal muscle, AMPD2 everywhere
else, but AMPD1 <strong>and</strong> AMPD2 expressed in cardiac tissue<a href="#references"><sup>21</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 id="diabetes-and-obesity">Diabetes and Obesity</h4>

<p>The C34T AMPD1 genotype was found to be significantly less common in
patients with diabetes in one study<a href="#references"><sup>22</sup></a>, and to also be associated with
lower prevalence of diabetes, lower blood pressure, waist circumference,
waist to hip ratio, and BMI <a href="#references"><sup>23</sup></a>. As well, another study found that in
mice that had developed insulin resistance, disruption of AMPD1 activity
lead to a less severe state of insulin resistance, improved glucose
tolerance, and enhanced insulin clearance<a href="#references"><sup>24</sup></a>. This is interesting, and
also consistent with the effects of Adenosine on insulin sensitivity
(though not conclusive).</p>

<h4 id="immune-function">Immune Function</h4>

<p>Adenosine is known to have anti-inflammatory effects, and so a recent
study aimed to assess the role of the AMPD1 genotype in infection. They
found that the presence of the mutant T allele increased the occurrence
of septic community acquired pneumonia, but not ventilator-associated
pneumonia. They hypothesized that while the increased adenosine levels
might be tissue-protective and limit organ damage (via reducing
inflammation), it could also lead to a more pronounced immunoparalysis,
which could impair immune response to some kinds of infection.<a href="#references"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="fatigue">Fatigue</h4>

<p>It seems like disruption of sleep homeostasis should be the most obvious
effect of too much Adenosine, but it wasn&rsquo;t until recently that two case
studies were presented linking hypersomnia (too much sleeping) to this
mutation in AMPD1, one in 2014<a href="#references"><sup>26</sup></a>, and one in 2016<a href="#references"><sup>27</sup></a>. Particularly
interesting is that in these case studies, one patient mentions that the
fatigue is exacerbated by exercise, and both mention that daytime sleep
typically only occurs during restful (read: boring) activities. Again,
this seems consistent with the idea that AMPD1 increases the rate at
which Adenosine is produced, and possible not just during exercise. I&rsquo;ve
drawn a simple figure to show what I mean:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/resources/AMPD1homeostasis.jpg" alt="Figure modified from
&lt;http://www.howsleepworks.com/&gt;" /></p>

<p>This time, blue still represents the level of Adenosine in a healthy
patient, but now the red line depicts how Adenosine levels might
increase in an AMPD1 mutant. If the rate of Adenosine generation is
higher, then perceived sleep need would also rise more quickly in these
patients (and possibly even high enough to be insufficiently dealt with
by a night of sleep). Furthermore, exercise would likely make this
acutely worse, as the sudden spike of ATP use in skeletal muscle would
lead to a spike in Adenosine levels. People with this mutation might
prefer exercising in the evening, rather than the morning.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Many of the observed effects of the AMPD1 mutation are consistent with increased levels of Adenosine:

<ul>
<li>Cardiac Protection</li>
<li>Insulin Sensitivity</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Innate Immune Suppression</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adenosine levels rise after exertion, but might also rise faster during rest as well, compared to WT individuals</li>
<li>Chronic Caffeine consumption might offer a partial solution (for some symptoms)

<ul>
<li>a 20-30% increase in the number of Adenosine receptors, but ~50% of them can be blocked when Caffeine is present</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Really good sleep and afternoon naps might be the best way to reduce Adenosine and manage fatigue, without side effects.</li>
<li>Symptoms are likely to be variably dependent on environment, because a partial recovery of functional AMPD1 can occur (at ~2% concentration) due to alternative splicing.

<ul>
<li>It is thought that this could be more meaningful in homozygotes, as AMPD1 transcripts are overproduced in response to lack of AMPD1 activity (and higher levels of AMP)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Due to the variable nature of the symptoms, and the effects of caffeine consumption, I suspect many people <strong>do</strong> experience symptoms, but don&rsquo;t think to associate them with any particular cause.</li>
</ul>
