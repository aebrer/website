      <description>Involved Parties:  Andrew Brereton Zach Ruggles Delia Brereton (my Mom)  The Story I used to live in Canada, until recently. I lived near a small town called Parry Sound; it was an eleven-minute drive into town from my house, and I lived at the top of a small hill overlooking a lake. In the summer it was warm and nice, and in the winter it was cold and entirely covered in snow.</description>

      <description>No wonder then, that Winter feels so unreal;
when the trees finally fall to their dreaming,
leaving the warm-blooded to their feverish movements,
like scratches of ink on a clean white page.</description>

      <description>A sliver of moon,
an airplane&amp;rsquo;s pale cloudy trail;
hanging in the sky.</description>

      <description>Shifting drifts of sand
Lazily etch their message
In the old king&amp;rsquo;s plaque.
Words that used to read
&amp;ldquo;Upon my works, ye mighty
Gaze and feel despair!&amp;rdquo;
Despite my straining,
All I sense is the endless
Whisper of the sands.</description>

      <description>Gray skies and
the soft rains fall
to tear the earth
and tease the trees
to struggle for heights.
Dimly then
their scent recalls
in short sweet bursts
old bitter dreams
of ancient paradise.
Now alone
amidst the sounds
of endless drips
upon the ground;
remember,
there is no rest
and no respite
but only tired and dim gray light.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Family</title>

      <description>I got out of the car, and shut the door a little too loud. The sound reverberates against the side of the barn, and seems to announce to the world, Stranger. Stranger Here. I know I’m paranoid. I know I feel this way partly because I know they won’t like the reasons why I’ve come here. This is what I have to do though. This is all I can do to make the world a little safer, a little better.</description>
