      <description>When I design a tattoo I like it to mean something personally to me. I also like for it to be unique, and to reflect my personality. With that in mind, I hoped to create a tattoo that would show some of the things I had learned here at OSU, while I was getting my PhD. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to pull that off, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to detail a little about how I made the tattoo here in this blog post.</description>

      <title>Mutants Among Us: the unexpected effects of a mutation in AMPD1</title>

      <description>Introduction Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve become interested in the effects of a particular mutation. The mutation is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a protein called Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase 1 (AMPD1). In this case, the nucleotide base at this position was supposed to be a &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; (cytosine), but it&amp;rsquo;s been changed to a &amp;ldquo;T&amp;rdquo; (thymine). This single letter mutation has been called &amp;ldquo;the most prevalent genetic disease mutation&amp;rdquo;, at least in Caucasians1.</description>

      <description>Datafest Oregon 2016 This year, I competed in Datafest. Datafest is a data analysis competition for students, with a corporate sponsor who provides the data. For this competition Ticketmaster provided the data, and Datafest itself was hosted by Dr. Charlotte Wickham, an assistant professor in the Statistics Department at OSU.
Our team was called &amp;ldquo;Pretty Terrestrial&amp;rdquo;, and consisted of myself, Michelle Wiley, Steven Freidman, and Camden Lopez. It was a lot of fun working together on this project, especially when it got down to crunch time in the final hour.</description>
