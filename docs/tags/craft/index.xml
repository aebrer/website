      <description>When I design a tattoo I like it to mean something personally to me. I also like for it to be unique, and to reflect my personality. With that in mind, I hoped to create a tattoo that would show some of the things I had learned here at OSU, while I was getting my PhD. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to pull that off, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to detail a little about how I made the tattoo here in this blog post.</description>

      <description>Total cost for parts and tools: $64 Time: 2 weeks Emotional damage: minimal  The Motivation So I really like the look to the Risa Solid Uke. However, it&amp;rsquo;s a little too rich for my blood at this point. One day I&amp;rsquo;ll buy one. In the meantime, I thought it might be cool to try to build my own poor man&amp;rsquo;s version (which ended up costing more than I expected).</description>

      <description>I got into homebrewing. I like beer so why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t I enjoy making beer?! For this first beer I ended up making an ESB I call the Fug Vale ESB. It was delicious, I only have two bottles left&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m considering sending one to my brother, but then again, I could just drink it. Sorry Calvin!
Here are a few pictures of that whole process:
Getting Started Some starting materials: yeast and hops.</description>
