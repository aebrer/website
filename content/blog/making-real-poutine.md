A month or two ago I decided I had had enough of the sub-par American
so-called poutine I have received here. I miss the cheesy, gravy
goodness of my homeland! So I gathered my favorite Americans, and showed
them the light (heavy).

The Problems
------------

I know I'm being a snob, but please forgive me. There are three main
problems (in my opinion) with how Americans tend to make poutine:

1.  Using grated cheese. DON'T DO THIS! You need those squeaky cheese
    curds for texture, for flavour, the whole deal! If I see orange
    grated cheddar on french fries referred to as poutine one more time,
    I'm leaving. In this batch of poutine, we went to the Tillamook
    Dairy and got fresh cheese curds. They weren't actually orange in
    person, thankfully.
2.  Not using enough gravy and cheese curds. Poutine is not about
    the french fries. It's about the gravy and the cheese. Seriously,
    cover that stuff with gravy. Kill it with gravy. You should be
    questioning whether or not there are actually fries in there.
3.  Trying to 'improve' it. When you get it right, then you can add
    things. Green onions? Delicious! Putting green onions on your
    poutine when you haven't even figured out the cheese? NO! The beauty
    of poutine is how simple and bad for you it is. You will taste
    french fries, you will taste cheese, you will taste gravy, you will
    taste salt. I seriously had some stinky-cheese and mushroom poutine
    with oysters in it (I'm looking at you Les Caves). When I expected
    poutine! The shame, the shock... I ate it though. I mean it wasn't
    bad, it just wasn't amazing.

gravy? That's just
right.](/blog/resources/making-real-poutine/1.jpg)

Cooking!
--------

So here are a few pictures from the poutine making experience. The bowl
of water is salt water for soaking the fries. Just cut some potatoes
into fry shapes and soak them for a few hours in water with salt and
sugar in it. Then deep fry them, in a deep frier or just a pot with hot
oil. Make sure the gravy gets nice and thick too!

important.](/blog/resources/making-real-poutine/2.jpg)

It's so low effort but well worth the
time.](/blog/resources/making-real-poutine/3.jpg)

The most important thing at this stage is to not just eat all the fries.
Now, you put the fries in, then the cheese curds (lots) then the gravy
(lots). I actually did not have enough cheese it turned out, so I ended
up being a little shy of ideal. Still, it turned out great!

everything.](/blog/resources/making-real-poutine/4.jpg)

That is good poutine (to me).
