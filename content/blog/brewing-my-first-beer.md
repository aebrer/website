I got into homebrewing. I like beer so why wouldn't I enjoy making beer?! For this first beer I ended up making an ESB I call the Fug Vale ESB. It was delicious, I only have two bottles left... I'm considering sending one to my brother, but then again, I could just drink it. Sorry Calvin!

Here are a few pictures of that whole process:

Getting Started
==============  

Some starting materials: yeast and hops. The bowl is my way of keeping
things sterile until I need
them.

This the the "cooking" part of the process, which turns out is way
easier than I expected. You essentially just boil everything for awhile.
The hardest part is finding a big pot to
use!

Fermentation
============

So here is the wort in primary fermentation, in my closet in my tiny
apartment. For this first batch I was so impatient, I checked it
multiple times a day. I almost panicked because it took almost 48h for
the yeast to really get
going.

A week later: crusty! I'm siphoning the beer into a glass carboy for
secondary fermentation (and more
waiting).

Taking a gravity reading and tasting! Yup, it's
beer!

Here we are, in my room of
requirement.

Bottling
========

So two weeks later, it's time to bottle. These bottles need to be
sterilized.

Here's about half the bottles. The aluminum foil is to prevent
particles from falling in after I've sterilized the bottles. All said, I
got 54x12oz bottles and 3x22 oz bottles, and one 16oz
bottle.

There is a wand that you can use to fill the bottles when
siphoning.

Caps need to be sterilized
too!

Beer after primary: a little
cloudy.

Beer after secondary: very
clear!

This capper pushes the caps onto the
bottles.

Finished
========

The finished product: a tasty beer with a custom
label!

Delicious. Overall, this might be one of my favorite tasting beers,
even if I hadn't made it myself. I hope my next one turns out this
well!

Bonus!
======

Here's a shot of my second brew, which I just racked to secondary
yesterday. A green tea
ale!
